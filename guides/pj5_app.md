### 1. Project Design and Features

#### 1.1 Grid Creation
- **Purpose**: Serve as the base interface for braid creation.
- **Features**: Create an NxN grid (default N = 8). Each cell in the grid can be clicked to toggle between active and inactive states.

#### 1.2 Mesh Generation
- **Purpose**: Overlay a mesh on the grid which will help in defining the crossing points (stitches) for the braid.
- **Features**: Allow cells to be marked as crossing points, toggled on or off, with each crossing uniquely identified by a numerical tag starting from 0.

#### 1.3 Crossing/Stitches Identification
- **Purpose**: Enable users to define where threads will cross and create visual stitches.
- **Features**: Users can click cells to toggle the crossing status. On toggle, cells should display their tag number.

#### 1.4 Yarn/Thread Path Definition
- **Purpose**: Define the path each thread will take through the grid, using the crossing points.
- **Features**: Provide a method for users to input sequences like "0, 3, 5, 7..." representing the path of the thread through crossing points.

#### 1.5 Braid Generation
- **Purpose**: Visualize the complete braid based on the defined paths and crossings.
- **Features**: Render threads weaving through the defined crossing points, visually simulating a braid.

#### 1.6 Interface and Navigation
- **Purpose**: Make the application user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Features**: Include buttons for each major step: setting up the grid, defining crossings, inputting thread paths, and generating the final braid. Include back and forth navigation between these steps.

### 2. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Grid Setup
- Create a basic p5.js setup with an NxN grid.
- Enable toggling cells on and off with mouse clicks.
- Designate a UI area for buttons and input forms for later phases.

#### Phase 2: Mesh and Crossings Setup
- Extend the grid to allow defining and tagging crossing points.
- Implement functionality to display numbers within cells that are designated as crossings.

#### Phase 3: Thread Path Input
- Add an input form where users can enter thread paths using crossing point tags.
- Validate user input to ensure paths use valid crossing tags.

#### Phase 4: Braid Visualization
- Implement the logic to render threads following the defined paths across the grid.
- Display different colors or styles for different threads to clearly show the braid pattern.

#### Phase 5: UI and Navigation
- Implement buttons to control the workflow: Setup Grid, Define Crossings, Define Paths, Generate Braid.
- Allow users to navigate back and adjust previous steps without losing all subsequent data.

### 3. Development Tools and Libraries
- **p5.js**: Main library for creating the drawing canvas and handling user interactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating buttons, input forms, and styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the application logic, including array manipulations and UI interactions.
