# Lacemaker Project

## Overview

**Lacemaker** is a software tool designed to generate meshed yarn structures for simulation and analysis of laces. The output files can be read by LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator).

## Features

- **JSON File Generation**: Create structured JSON files that accurately represent yarn meshes, including details on yarn crossings, nodes, paths, and repetitions.
- **LAMMPS Integration**: Designed to seamlessly export the generated mesh structures into LAMMPS for further simulation and analysis.
- **Yarn Pattern Analysis**: Tools and guidelines for analyzing yarn patterns, identifying repetition, and understanding structural characteristics.
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition**: Ability to define and refine Regions of Interest within the yarn mesh for focused simulation.
- **Flexible Mesh Representation**: Supports multiple approaches to defining the mesh structure, allowing for both detailed and simplified representations depending on the project's needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the Lacemaker repository to your local machine. Ensure that Python is installed and properly configured.

2. **Generate JSON Files**: Follow the guide included in the project to create JSON representations of your yarn mesh. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to analyze the yarn pattern, identify nodes and paths, and define the characteristics of each yarn.

3. **Export to LAMMPS**: Once your JSON file is ready, use the provided `lace_maker.py` script to generate the input files for LAMMPS. This script converts the JSON structure into a format that LAMMPS can understand.

4. **Simulation and Analysis**: With the LAMMPS input files prepared, you can now proceed to simulate the yarn mesh. Use LAMMPS to analyze the mechanical properties, dynamics, and interactions within the mesh.

5. **Visualize Results**: Tools like OVITO and VMD can be used to visualize the simulation results, offering insights into the structural integrity and behavior of the yarn mesh under various conditions.
